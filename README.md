# Development 

This was made with Rust's Tauri desktop container and rust backend and React for the UI and native CSS. 

<!--Developer's comments-->
<!---I had fun making this app. Getting used to Rust's syntax was challenging, but it was fun and perfomant in the end. Updates will be pushed in the future!:) -->
